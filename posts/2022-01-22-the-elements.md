The book [*Elements of ∞-Category Theory*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/elements-of-category-theory/DAC48C449AB8C2C1B1E528A49D27FC6D) by Emily Riehl and Dom Verity has just been published (online, January 2022) by [Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org) as volume 194 of the series [Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematic](https://www.cambridge.org/core/series/cambridge-studies-in-advanced-mathematics/0A5F361E5A5E9D3EFE58F53613C0D307). Here's what the reviewers are saying:

> *'Emily and Dom have done what many thought impossible: they have written an introductory text on a model-independent approach to higher category theory. This self-contained text is ideal for both end-users and architects of higher category theory. Every page is bursting at the seams with gorgeous insights and the refreshingly candid delight the authors take in their subject.'*\
> [Clark Barwick - University of Edinburgh]{.underline}

> *'This remarkable book starts with the premise that it should be possible to study infinity-categories armed only with the tools of 2-category theory. It is the result of the authors' decade-long collaboration, and they have poured into it all their experience, technical brilliance, and expository skill. I’m sure I’ll be turning to it for many years to come.'*\
> [Steve Lack - Macquarie University]{.underline}

I'm planning to use this blog to introduce some supplementary materials and extra content that didn't make it into final cut of published version of "The Elements". Subscribe to my [RSS feed](/rss.xml) to keep up with developments.
