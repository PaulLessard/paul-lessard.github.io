Back in the heady days of March 2023 I did an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rie-9AEhYdY) with Tim & Keith of [Machine Learning Street Talk](https://www.patreon.com/mlst). In the year and half since I've learned a great deal; about machine learning, about business, and about antibiotics as rosacea treatment.

I did another brief [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBjCvB_4mdo&t=2340s) with Tim and Keith in June of this year, the last time I visited Symbolica's London office.

While I think my outfit and hair are better in this second talk, the interview was far more all over the place. So I figured I'd give a shot at collecting my hard earned lessons and listing them here.

## Moritz Hardt's Book

The book I was plugging of Hardt's is this: [The Emerging Science of Machine Learning Benchmarks](https://mlbenchmarks.org/) The kind of book I wish I knew enough to write!
