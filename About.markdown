*\"I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality, and freedom for their spirits.\"* - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Norway 1964

His professional and leadership career at Macquarie University includes 6 years as a member of the executive of the Division of Information and Communication Sciences (a precursor to the Faculty of Science and Engineering), 6 years as a member of the University's Academic Program Committee, 4 years as Chair of the Senate Learning and Teaching Committee and 4 years as Chair of Academic Senate. In that latter rôle he also held ex officio membership of Macquarie's governing body, the University Council.

He has also worked outside the University sector, holding positions in the IT, Finance and Risk Management industries. In those rôles his research experience extends to the application of qualitative and quantitative methods in the areas of software systems design, financial portfolio management and risk mitigation.

He holds both a Vice Chancellor's award and an ALTC national citation for Excellence in Teaching. These recognise his love of his discipline and his penchant for sharing that with his students. As a University Governor his policy interests are shaped by a passion for improving the student experience and for ensuring that this weakest group in the University community are treated equitably.
