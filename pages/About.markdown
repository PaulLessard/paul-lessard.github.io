*\"I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality, and freedom for their spirits.\"* - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Norway 1964

Dom Verity is a research Mathematician who sidelines include Programming, Electronics, incredibly bad Drumming, and University Governance.

His professional and leadership career at Macquarie University includes 6 years as a member of the executive of the Division of Information and Communication Sciences (a precursor to the Faculty of Science and Engineering), 4 years as the Chair of the University's Learning and Teaching Committee (SLTC) and 4 years as Chair of Academic Senate. In that latter rôle he also held ex officio membership of Macquarie's governing body, the University Council.

He has also worked outside the University sector, holding positions in the IT, Finance and Risk Management industries. In those rôles his research experience extends to the application of qualitative and quantitative methods in the areas of software systems design, financial portfolio management and risk mitigation.

He holds both a Vice Chancellor's award and an ALTC national citation for Excellence in Teaching. These recognise his love of his discipline and his penchant for sharing that with his students. As a University Governor his policy interests are shaped by a passion for improving the student experience and for ensuring that this weakest group in the University community are treated equitably.

Dom Verity started his computational career in the early 1980s as a software developer for the influential British personal computing pioneer Acorn Computers; the company that invented the now ubiquitous ARM microprocessor. He went on from there to work for the BBC World Service, where he was involved in designing and developing microcomputer technologies for application in radio production departments. He studied at the University of Cambridge (UK) and emerged from that institution in 1992 with a PhD in Pure Mathematics. From 1993-2000 he worked in the investment banking industry, as a mathematical consultant in derivative securities valuation and hedging, as a quantitative analyst in equity derivatives for Deutsche Bank Australia and as the Head of Equity Derivatives Trading for HSBC Australia.

He returned to academe at the turn of the new millennium, and since then has worked as a mathematician, computer scientist, and academic administrator at Macquarie University. His research interests lie in the mathematical fields of Homotopy Theory, sometimes known as “rubber sheet geometry”, Algebraic Topology and Category Theory, a kind of “theory of everything” for pure mathematics. He is also active in exploring applications of this work to the Computer Science of Programming Languages. His most cited paper introduced “Traced Monoidal Categories”, structures that have become a key component in modern accounts of iterative processes in traditional and quantum computation. In recent years, he has held visiting Professorship positions at Harvard University, John’s Hopkins University, the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute at Berkeley, and the University of Cambridge.

Professor Verity is a passionate and engaging teacher and in 2008 his contributions in this area were recognised by the award of a Macquarie University Vice-Chancellor's Award for Teaching Excellence. In 2011 he also gained national recognition as an educator with the award of an Australian Learning and Teaching Council Citation for Outstanding Contribution to Student Learning “For a decade of inspirational and innovative educational leadership in the field of information technology”. Over the past two decades, has also been highly active in academic leadership roles at the Department, Faculty and University levels. Most recently he led Macquarie’s academic governance as Chair of its Academic Senate.
