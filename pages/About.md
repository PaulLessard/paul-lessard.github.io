*\"'Certainty is never achieved'; 'foundations' are never found - but the 'cunning of reason' turns each increase in rigor into an increase in content... \"* - Imre Lakatos, Proofs and Refutations, p.60

Paul Lessard is a Research Mathematician trained in:

- homotopy theory
- category theory; and
- (algebraic, differential, etc.) geometry;

now working (largely) in:

- deep learning

### Bio:

After "seeing the light" at the centre of Australian Category Theory as postdoc (2019-2021)

#### Education: The Evergreen State College, the University of Vermont, the University of Colorado Boulder

#### Academic Career #1: Macquarie University

#### Applied/Industrial Turn: Symbolica

For ~2.5 years Paul served as principal scientist at the venture backed startup [Symbolica](https://www.symbolica.ai/). Hired in August 2023, Paul, along with John Wilmes and Bruno Gavranovic, totally replaced the research program of struggling Bay Area startup Symbolica. Bruno and Paul, in collaboration with [Andrew Dudzik](https://mdudzik.github.io/), [Tamara von Glehn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gUWlWJgAAAAJ&hl=en), [João G. M. Araújo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=WL9vouMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Petar Veličković](https://petar-v.com/) of [Google Deepmind](https://deepmind.google/), published the influential paper [Categorical Deep Learning](https://categoricaldeeplearning.com/) at ICML 2024.

Then, in February and March of 2024 these three researchers, along with the CEO George Morgan and CPO Jay Frydman, presented and pitched this new plan - half of which followed on from the paper with an industrial program in the application of category and type theory to machine learning and AI. Together. They raised 31 million dollars in a Series A covered in [Venture Beat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/move-over-deep-learning-symbolicas-structured-approach-could-transform-ai) and elsewhere. Paul has since left Symbolica.
