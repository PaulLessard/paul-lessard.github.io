    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in the heady days of March 2023 I did an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rie-9AEhYdY">interview</a> with Tim &amp; Keith of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mlst">Machine Learning Street Talk</a>. In the year and half since I’ve learned a great deal; about machine learning, about business, and about antibiotics as rosacea treatment.</p>
<p>I did another brief interview with Tim and Keith in June of this year, the last time I visited Symbolica’s London office.</p>
<p>While I think my outfit and hair are better in this second talk, the interview was far more all over the place. So I figured I’d give a shot at collecting my hard earned lessons and listing them here.</p>
